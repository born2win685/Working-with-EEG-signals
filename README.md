# Working-with-EEG-signals
Electroencephalography is an efficient modality to acquire and study brain signals
from different regions of the scalp. EEG measures voltage fluctuations resulting
from ionic current within the neurons of the brain.
They are categorized into different categories based on their frequency.They are
delta (0.5-4Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-14 Hz), beta (14-30Hz) and gamma (above 30Hz)
A data set was chosen from internet.It was of a alcoholic subject(person).The EEG data is
taken with many electrodes.The data set used in this project is of one electrode.
The signal is separated into alpha ,beta and delta by use of a band pass filter made
from scratch.The different categories of the signal obtained are compared with one
obtained using in-built filter.For practical purposes,we will be processing only the data
recorded from the C Channel of the EEG Data.
Matlab software was used to process the signal.The data set is of alcoholic person.
